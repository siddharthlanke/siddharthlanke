# Siddharth Mohan Lanke

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's my story so far: buckle up, grab some popcorn (or ice cream üç¶), and let's dive into my journey.

## üë®‚Äçüéì **From a Curious Kid to a Data Science Aficionado**

I started my academic journey with a **BE in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** at Savitribai Phule Pune University, where I graduated with a shiny CGPA of **8.98** (yeah, I worked hard for those numbers). During this time, I explored everything from **cybersecurity** to **machine learning** as a team leader in college projects.

But why stop there? I hopped onto the big league with an **MSc in Data Science (Business and Management)** at the University of Manchester. My academic highlights include an **A+ grade** in subjects like **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Quantum AI**. (Yes, I too wanted to sound fancy like "quantum" in the title.)

Oh, and did I mention I bagged the **Bicentenary Global Futures Scholarship**? It came with ambassador duties, because apparently, being smart also means being social ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Projects**

Here‚Äôs some of the cool stuff I‚Äôve worked on:

- **RAG Pipeline Using Langflow:** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built using Langflow, Astra DB, Ollama embeddings, and the Llama3.2 LLM. Demonstrated document ingestion, vector storage, and context-aware question answering using a custom PDF story (Shadows of Eldoria).
- **J.A.R.V.I.S.-Inspired AI Assistant:** Developed an AI assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. with efficient Ollama API integrations.
- **Drowsiness Detection with YOLOv8:** Enhancing driver safety with a **90% detection rate** (because sleeping while driving isn‚Äôt cool üò¥üöó).
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning:** Trained an AI agent to outsmart humans in a classic game (it's like I‚Äôm Skynet, but less dangerous ü§ñ).
- **Twitter Sentiment Investing Strategy:** Using social media vibes to make smart investment moves (thanks, Elon?).
- **google-rss-emailer:** A Python automation system that scrapes RSS feeds and sends emails with the Gmail API. Because who has time for manual labor?
- **Astronomical Data Visualization:** Crafted visualizations for astronomical data to uncover hidden insights.
- **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project:** Completed this project to demonstrate advanced analytics skills and storytelling.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ **Ice Creams, Events, and a Pinch of Leadership**

Life isn‚Äôt just about data and code! I helped my dad revamp our **family ice cream shop**, proving that vanilla can be exciting üç¶. My efforts increased revenue (modernization FTW).

I also spent over a year as the **Production Head at Jim Dandy Events**, managing 10 large weddings (think bridezillas and chaotic families). It was here I turned from an introvert into someone who could handle just about any people-related challenge.

Here‚Äôs a little shoutout from Sona Walvekar, Founder & CEO of Jim Dandy Events:
> "Your punctuality, politeness, and hard work have consistently stood out. You have shown an
exceptional ability to learn quickly and remain calm under pressure, which is invaluable in our
industry. Your composed demeanor and ability to handle unexpected challenges with grace
have set you apart as a reliable and effective team member."
